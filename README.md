# Frood 75% Keyboard

This repo is for a PCB made using KiCAD that, when fabricated, gives a 75% mechanical keyboard that works with the [Frood microcontroller from 42 keebs](https://42keebs.eu/shop/parts/controllers/frood-rp2040-pro-micro-controller/).
The correct export files are located in the Gerber Export zip folder.

This keyboard follows a layout of 75%, with 81 keys and a EC11 rotary encoder.

The 3d-printable case is currently a WIP. I will update this repo when it is done.
